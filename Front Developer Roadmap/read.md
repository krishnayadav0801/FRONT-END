# 🚀 Frontend Development Roadmap

## 📌 What is Frontend Development?
Frontend development is the process of building the part of a website or app that users directly interact with.  
It includes structure (HTML), design (CSS), interactivity (JavaScript), UI frameworks, performance, security, and user experience.

A frontend developer builds fast, responsive, accessible, and secure interfaces using modern tools and technologies.
